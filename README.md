### Hi there üëã, I'm Adri√°n Molina L√≥pez

I'm a Senior Fullstack Developer currently working at Tailor Hub. While I prefer backend development, I am equally comfortable handling front-end tasks. I have expertise in optimizing performance, managing complex data systems, and developing robust backend solutions. I thrive on simplifying complex systems and delivering high-quality, maintainable code.

#### A bit about me...

- üè† Temporarily based in Albal, Valencia, Spain, but born in and planning to return to Zaragoza.
- üéÇ Born on May 27th, 2000.

- üåê Connect with me on LinkedIn: [Adri√°n Molina L√≥pez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amolinalopez/)

#### My top hard skills...

- **Programming Languages:** Rust, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, C, Go.
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** NestJS, React.js, Angular, Node.js, Next.js, Jotai.
- **Other Tech:** Docker, Git, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Prisma, Tailwind CSS, Linux, and more.
- **DevOps Tools:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Qovery, Kubernetes basics, and Asana for project management.
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Snowflake.
- **Front-end Philosophy:** I enjoy exploring innovative approaches, such as the signals model in SolidJS, which aligns with my interest in efficient state management.

#### Notable Projects

- [Competencias](https://github.com/iacs-biocomp/competencias): Led the development of an application enabling peer-to-peer evaluations of employees within a company using TypeScript, NestJS, and Angular.
- [gitstat-rs](https://github.com/aml360/gitstat-rs): A Rust-based rewrite of Gitstat using parallel computing techniques for improved performance.
- [rust-practices](https://github.com/aml360/rust_practices): A repository where I practiced advanced Rust features, including borrowing mechanics, unsafe code, FFI examples, and compiler optimizations (e.g., stack usage optimization by managing variable scopes, visualized using Godbolt). It also includes examples for OOP-like patterns, traits, and advanced memory handling such as forced deallocation and segmentation faults. Additionally, it features examples using older versions of napi-rs, as I am exploring how Rust can be used to enhance languages like Python and JavaScript.

#### My Philosophy as a Developer

I focus on continuous improvement, efficient problem-solving, and delivering scalable solutions. My adaptable mindset helps me embrace new challenges and learn constantly.

#### Beyond Coding

I am driven by a deep passion for knowledge and continuous self-improvement. I enjoy bouldering and cycling. I competed in cycling for five years, achieving the title of Regional Youth Champion in Arag√≥n, as showcased in [this link](https://aragonciclismo.com/es/smartweb/seccion/noticia/aragon/Campeonatos-Aragon/12261-Adrian-Molina-Ecotisa-Goerna-Campeon-de-Aragon-en-Villatuerta). I also find great satisfaction in building things, from DIY projects to digital tools, reflecting my innate curiosity about how things work. Embracing a minimalist lifestyle, I strive to simplify and prioritize what truly adds value, both personally and professionally.
